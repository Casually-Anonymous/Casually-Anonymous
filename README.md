- 👋 Hi, I’m @Casually-Anonymous
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and mods.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, but I might also pick up C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, I'd like familiarize myself first (but I did share a game idea with a friend who knows more about game development, and
- they said that they'll make a mockup of it when they have free time.
- 📫 How to reach me: through here, though I can't guarentee that I'll respond right away.
